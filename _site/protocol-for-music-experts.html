<ul>
  <li>After the children have completed their tasks in testing, each child will have a song output from the tasks that they have done.</li>
  <li>The sequence of the tasks that were done can be seen in the Tasks page, this is to be used in gauging if there was an improvement in the compositions that were made by the kids.</li>
  <li>The music samples that they have done will then be forwarded to music experts for them to comment on the learning that the child has done throughout the different days of using the application. We will personally be giving these music samples in a google drive to each music expert with the identity of each child anonymized. We will also be giving information about the childâ€™s experience in regards to music.</li>
  <li>Aside from this the music experts will be given the expected sound of the song with the corresponding music sheet in tasks that they were required to copy a particular song.</li>
  <li>Music Experts are asked to fill out this <a href="/assets/forms/Music-Expert-Evaluation-Form.pdf"><strong>form</strong></a></li>
