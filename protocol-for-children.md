## Overview and Objectives
- We are currently the 3rd stage of our research. We have made 3 versions of the application and in this version we would want to test the learning of the child when the child accomplishes the 5 tasks to be given.

- For this version of testing we plan to test 6 - 12 children who are aged 5-8 using the application. Ideally, we would like to have a balance between children that enroll in a music school/have experience and also those that are not experienced in music. We would also want a balance between the genders of the participants and a variety in their age.
- Before testing, specific details about the tasks would be explained. It is also advisable that the parents supervise the child so that the order of the tasks will be followed.
- The tasks will be designed in a way that the child will have an audio output that will be given to the music experts for evaluation. We would also explain this more in depth during the online call between us and the children with their parents. The homepage of the application will have 5 different tasks that the child will have to do. Selecting one task would lead to a new screen where they would do their respective tasks. 
- Please refer to the [**tasks**](tasks.md) page to see detailed tasks.
