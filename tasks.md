## Task 4: Remaking a song!
- Recreate part of song without the assistance of a music sheet. (London Bridge is Falling Down) 
- For this task we will let the child compose a short and very familiar song which is London Bridge is Falling Down, for this task we will be requiring the child to create the same song with them just listening to it. 
- The song can be heard by accessing the mp3 file below.

## Task 5: Transforming notes into music!
- Recreate part of the song with only a music sheet (Twinkle, twinkle, little stars). 
- For this last task, the child will be asked to compose the song using the music sheet while listening to the song. 
- There is no more visual assistance from the firefly to help you compared to task 2 and 3, as they will be using the music sheet provided below and the song to compose the music sheet.
- The song can be heard by accessing the mp3 file below.
